		/*Question 7: Assume the following declarations:
int x = 1;
boolean isFree = false;
char initial = 'L';
char code = 'Y';
String english = "hi";
String italian = "ciao";
boolean q = (5 == 6);

For each of the following expressions, indicate if it creates a syntax error or
not. If there is no error, indicate the value of the expression.

(true && (5>6))
Answer: Expression value is false
((x!=0) || (x%2 == 1))
Answer: Expression value is true
(isFree | (x<0))
Answer: Expression value is false
initial == code
Answer: Expression value is false
!!q
Answer: Expression value is false
(0 <= x <= 10)
Answer: Syntax error. It should be ((x<=10)&&(x>=0)),
and the value is true
(english > italian)
Answer: Syntax error.
(isFree) ? 4 : 10
Answer: Expression value is 10
initial = code
Answer: Expression value is ’Y’ and after this
statement, the value of “initial” will be changed to
‘Y’ (the value of “code”)
"italian".equals(italian)
Answer: Expression value is false*/
